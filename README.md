# Intro
My Java implementation of document editor based on book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". Almost all classes have to be implemented by yourself, because only the abstract classes and interfaces that should be used are described in the book. The book only describes the patterns to use and why. I want to try to implement it. 

# Progress
The first text can be displayed in the editor. I'm so happy :). But the code needs to be cleaned up.
